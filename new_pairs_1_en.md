# Song "Pair Hunter"

### Verse 1
New dawn breaks light,  
Hundreds of exchanges hide their might.  
Searching for pairs in the quiet.

Five minutes wait,  
API signals to calculate.  
A new pair - fortune smiles!

### Chorus
Algorithms like wind through the fields,  
Trading - a warrior's path, never yields.  
New pairs - treasures within the net,  
Being first to see means victory is set!

### Verse 2
Pair is discovered,  
Now we ping uncovered.  
Waiting for first trades' trace.

Volume and price -  
Information precise.  
Five seconds - the world transformed.

### Chorus
Algorithms like wind through the fields,  
Trading - a warrior's path, never yields.  
New pairs - treasures within the net,  
Being first to see means victory is set!

### Finale
Hundreds of exchanges - one gaze,  
A new pair - trader's golden phase.  
Eternal search - our way.
